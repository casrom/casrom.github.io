This is the second iteration of the previous Gateway project. It started with a digital rendering of a rotating prism lamp. The lit surface represents a digital bit, and when it's facing the viewer it represents 1, and 0 otherwise. The realization of this digital concept came with many challenges.

A triangular prism is chosen for creating a "flat" illusion of the led lit screen.

The motor had to be imbedded inside the prism to allow arbitrary rotation in any direction.

A turntable bearing is installed to allow stabilization, even under rather high speed of rotation.

By imbedding the motor inside, the base is minimized.

The prism also has a self calibration system for it to rotate to the front when powered.

The installation space is prepared by painting the wall black; with a shape that mimic light through the gateway.

I custom made a triangular pedestal, which was not the easiest thing to do.

The proximity sensor activates the sculpture when viewers approach, and a hidden Lidar in the pedestal uses distance information to animate the gateway light sculpture.
