This project was initiated as a tailored database management system for the Ratcliff Lab at Georgia Tech. The lab has many frozen tubes of specimen stored in a freezer. On the left is a direct visualization of all the existing boxes in the archive, color-coded by experiment as shown on the top-right. 

Batch archive is an archival tool that allows researchers to place multiple specimen from parallel evolutionary experiments. 

One can also assign types for each box simply by dragging the legend onto the box.
