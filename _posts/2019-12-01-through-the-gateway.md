The project futher extends on the idea of doors, particularly the gateway that reaches into virtuality.

Upon entering the gateway, the viewer will be brought to one of the several "spaces" realized via projection, sound, and interaction. 

One of such spaces is the "Meadow," which originated from one of my visions, depicting a strange meadow that turned into a disastrous tsunami.

The "Membrane" is an audio space, where depending the location of the viewer, the sound output from the speaker will change accordingly, thus creading an "invisible membrane" that lingers in space.
