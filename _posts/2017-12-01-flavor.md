As a class project, we created an web app that allows the user to study food ingredients based on their flavors. When the user selects an ingredient, a network visualization is displayed showing shared flavors between the ingredients. The user then can select ingredients from an array of categories, forming their unique combination. Using the selections, the app can also recommend similar pre-existing recipes.

The app also includes a model config page that allows the user to upload formatted data to regenerate recommendation models.
